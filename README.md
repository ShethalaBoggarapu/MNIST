# MNIST Digit Prediction

## Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to building and training a model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions visualization.

## Key Features
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Model building using TensorFlow.
- Training and validation.
- Visualizing predictions.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the environment and run the notebook on your own machine.

### Prerequisites
You'll need Python installed on your system, along with the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation
